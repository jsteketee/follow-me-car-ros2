# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project Overview

ROS2 stack for a follow-me RC car. Runs on a Raspberry Pi 4B mounted on the car. Communicates with an ESP32-S3 HAL over USB serial. The ESP32 handles all hardware I/O (UWB ranging, IMU, camera, RPM, servo PWM); this repo contains all navigation and control logic.

Companion ESP32 firmware: `follow-me-car-esp32` repo, `ros2-hal` branch.

## Coding Rules

- Never include Claude attribution in git commit messages.
- Python nodes follow ROS2 naming conventions: `snake_case` for files, nodes, topics, and parameters.
- C++ packages (hardware interface, controllers) follow ROS2/ament conventions.

## Serial Protocol (ESP32 ↔ Pi)

**Incoming from ESP32 (50 Hz target, newline-delimited JSON):**
```json
{"ts":12345,"uwb_dist":183.2,"uwb_bearing":-12.4,"yaw":23.4,"pitch":0.1,"roll":-0.3,"speed":1.82,"odo":4821.3,"enc_speed":1.79,"cogging":0,"cam_found":1,"cam_x":0.23,"cam_y":0.11,"fused_angle":5.2,"fused_dist":185.0,"fused_unc":17.3}
```
`ts` (ms) is the ESP32 device timestamp — Pi computes dt from device time, not arrival time.
`uwb_dist` (cm) + `uwb_bearing` (deg) are Kalman-filtered DW3000 AoA readings; -1 if no fix.
`speed`/`odo` are hall-effect derived. `enc_speed` is AS5600 encoder EMA velocity (mph, forward
positive) for Pi-side cogging detection; `cogging` is the ESP32 latching cogging flag (0/1).
`fused_angle`/`fused_dist`/`fused_unc` are the ESP32's Kalman-fused bearing, distance, and
bearing variance — streamed because Pi-side fusion is deferred post-interview.

**Outgoing to ESP32 (on demand, newline-delimited JSON):**
```json
{"target_speed":1.8,"target_angle":-12.4}
```
Setpoints feed the ESP32's existing tuned PID loops (decided 2026-07-04 — see PROJECT_PLAN.md
"Control Loop Placement"). The protocol reserves a raw-actuator mode
(`{"throttle":0.31,"steering":-0.18}`) for the post-interview migration of the loops to the Pi.
ESP32 applies a cmd-timeout failsafe: neutral throttle if no command arrives within the timeout.
